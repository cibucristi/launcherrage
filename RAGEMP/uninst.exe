If you were smart enough to install RAGE Multiplayer into an empty folder (e.g., not into GTA V folder), you can run installer again and it'll uinstall RAGE Multiplayer from your PC. 
Removing it through Settings -> "Programs And Features" is also an option.


!! If you weren't that smart though, it's recommended to manually delete it's files as running uninstaller will remove the directory RAGE Multiplayer is installed into with RAGE Multiplayer files (e.g, GTA V files if you installed it into it's folder).
